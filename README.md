# inuyasha-ao3-skin
HTML/CSS for use with ao3

## How to use
There are multiple ways this can be used. The most basic/easiest way would be
to add the work skin when editing the work and adding the desired HTML. With
HTML/CSS knowledge, the desired pieces can be used in a custom work skin or
even added inline with the html.

## HTML
The HTML that needs to be added to the written work itself. You can either set
up the HTML yourself for the whole fic or post the fic in the rich text editor,
save it, and then open it back up for editing. After that, you just need to place
the desired HTML wherever desired. The design is made for easy copy/pasting. There
is a div that acts as a container for the pieces of the design. Just copy the
container and all of the elements inside and paste where you want it.
